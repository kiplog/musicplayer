musicplayer
===========

Simple musicplayer


This is a simple jquery music player. Primarily an exercise project to:
- learn github
- learn how to convert a script into a plugin
- get something up on github


The todo list for the code:
  	 Autoplay controls shouldn't be needed - the jquery should trigger the first song.
	   Encapsulating the jquery for distribution as a plug-in
	   Keystroke pause option
	   When one song ends, play the next
	   Maybe an animated slide out would be nice (an easy)
	   Style themes?
